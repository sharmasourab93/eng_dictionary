Description: A Beautiful Soup based English Dictionary 
        
        An English Dictionary Implementation to explore Databases in depth.
        The main method extracts the meaning of the word from the Cambridge Univ.site, if the meaning doesn't exist in the dictionary database.
        After parsing from the site, it prints the meaning and inserts it into the dictionary database.
        Once the meaning has been inserted into the dictionary database, look up takes O(1) time.
